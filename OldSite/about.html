    <h1>Coffee: The Superior Beverage</h1>
    <h2>Bitter Happiness</h2>
  </header>

  <p>I love coffee. Black coffee, iced coffee, espresso, and cappuccino.
     I've been drinking coffee for a long time. Its properties as a stimulant
     are useful at times, but more than that, I enjoy coffee for its complex flavors.
     Coffee comes in a million different varieties. To the new coffee drinker however,
     it may only taste bitter. Usually this is a result of the bitter flavors one is
     not used to overpowering the other flavors. Once you acclimate to the bitterness,
     the complexity and variety of different coffee blends are really interesting.
     Fruity blends, smoky blends, light roast, dark roast — the possibilities are endless.
     Additionally, the politics of the coffee trade are very relevant, as coffee is
     one of the most widely traded goods in the world.
