  <h1>OMG - A Quiz!</h1>

  <h2>The top three most impactful things I have learned so far in CS Topics:</h2>

  <h4>1) How to use github. We've been using github for a long time, but I only now know that github is a powerful tool for version control.</h3>
  <h4>2) How the internet actually connects information and users. Most people, including me, treat the internet as a black box. Having an introductory understanding of how it actually functions is very interesting.</h3>
  <h4>3) That you can view the source code and related information of any webpage with DevTools. This is very interesting to use on complex sites to see how they are structured.</h3>
